Success quaries and commands


**note - when inserting into table, do we need to match the type of data inserted with the type of data passed.
**note - do the parentheses in the insert or create staatement needs a space before them or not eg FROM() or FROM ().
**note - project, rename, select should be a keyword i guess and it should be in small letters..doubt
**note - * is for cross product
**note - what all data types have we created
